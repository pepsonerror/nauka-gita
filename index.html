            <p>
                I've created my crucifixion, felt the affixation
                Circled my own stage, incited the crowd's rage
                Called out all my own crimes, defenses sublime
                I struck the gavel down hard, followed the path of the bard
            </p>
            <p>
                The passers-by begin to look
                The last move took out my rook
                The game played with their advantage
                The castle ran by crooks
                Their pointing fingers seek out my face
                In hopes reveal my disgrace
                I won't beg for justice or mercy
                Won't play the part adversely
            </p>
            <p>
                My epilogue is written
                But words continue to change
                My epilogue is written
                In the end no one to blame
            </p>
            <p>
                Let the punishment fit the deed
                At last I'll concede
                Weary of the sentence
                The scales balancing
                My actions are justified
                See so ramified
                Truth be known and revealed
                Official record unsealed
            </p>
